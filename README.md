OjiSoft's repo for all its projects

Merging main into a branch with the name '\[project name\]-production' will build, test and deploy that particular project:
- OjiSoft Identity Provider -> identity.ojisoft.com
- OjiSoft Account Portal UI -> ojisoft.com
- OjiSoft Account Portal API -> api.ojisoft.com
- OjiSocial UI -> ojisocial.net
- OjiSocial API -> api.ojisocial.net

For easy mass building, testing, and deploying, the dev.cmd runs the local development toolkit contained in ./Source/
